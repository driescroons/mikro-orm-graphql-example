# mikro-orm-graphql-example

A MikroORM boilerplate for GraphQL made with Typescript using TypeGraphQL

## üì¶ Packages

- [MikroORM](https://mikro-orm.io/)
- [GraphQL](https://graphql.org/)
- [TypeGraphQL](https://typegraphql.com/)
- [Typescript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/)
- [Mocha](https://mochajs.org/)

I've also created a [package](https://github.com/driescroons/graphql-fields-to-relations) (`graphql-fields-to-relations`) that converts the input fields to a list of relation strings. These strings can be passed directly to MikroOrm, in order to load the requested relations.

## ‚ö°Ô∏è Usage

### Running

Once the server starts, you can access the GraphQL API on [localhost:8080/graphql](http://localhost:4080/graphql).

I've included 4 options to run this application:

#### Run with Node

Run the regular start command

#### Run with ts-node-dev

Run and watch the application in Typescript. Checkout [ts-node-dev](https://www.npmjs.com/package/ts-node-dev)

#### Run with debugger

I've added the launch script for VSCode in the repository. You can start the application by going to the Debug and Run tab and clicking on `Debug Application`

#### Test driven with Mocha Test Explorer

[Mocha Test Explorer](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=hbenl.vscode-mocha-test-adapter) allows you to run and debug your mocha tests from a nice UI within VSCode. Install the extension and get going!

### Migrations

After developing a feature, run the following commands to create a migration from the previous migration schema state:

```
yarn mikro-orm schema:drop --run
yarn mikro-orm migration:up
yarn mikro-orm migration:create
```
